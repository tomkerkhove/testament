# Testament

One day I will not be there anymore, so let's be prepared.

- **Sponsorship**
  - Send out a communication that I have passed so people can sponsor other maintainers
  - Donate all my sponsorship income to Alzheimer's & Dementia research
- **Projects**
  - Provide a notice in the README that I have passed
  - If I have not documented a suitable replacement maintainer, I'd love to archieve the repo unless a foundation wants to host it instead
- **Licensing**
  - All projects should remain under MIT licensing so that everyone can use and extend it, unless a foundation wants to host it instead
